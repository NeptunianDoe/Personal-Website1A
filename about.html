                <p>Hey there! I'm Denica Samuels, a lifelong student gathering all sorts of tools and trinkets I can use in creating anything my heart desires. Translating my creativity into passion-fueled purpose that serves the needs of myself and others is my why. I'm currently focused on building up and breaking down bits of code, into dynamic and responsive websites that tickle my aesthetic bone. When not doing that, I am tucked away into a novel, planning my next travel adventure, or locked away with some other hobby of mine. I feel most fufilled when experiencing something nuanced and most alive when learning something new.</p>
